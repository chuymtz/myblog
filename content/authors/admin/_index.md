Mathematical scientist with professional experience in the Oil & Gas industry. 
My contributions range from numerical methods to a variety of statistical analysis. 

I'm an individual who enjoys making a difference at the technical level but also as a group member. 
I believe that developing valuable tools and insights is an iterative and collaborative process.

I'm also interested in computational methods to analyze Multiplexed Immunofluorescence image data. Specifically, I'm interested in spatial methods to draw insights from point-process patterns.
