I'm hoping publishing a blog might force me to organize things I learn which I could say are substantial milestones. 

Before finishing my PhD it felt that I was in a state of continous learning but in a structured mannered. Learn the basis and build upon that. 

As much as I have enjoyed the last 5 years working in industry, learning is a scattered mess. 
Learn _A_ as quickly as you can whether you like it or not lol :grimacing:

Attempting to collaborate and help on independent research projects has also been a huge benefit. 

The downside of course is that it truly feels like holding 2 jobs and renting my time.
